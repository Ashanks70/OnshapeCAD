## CAD_Swing_Arm 

### Description

This assignment asked me to replicate a swing arm part from a set of drawings. The assignment style is similar to a portion of the Onshape Associate Certification test.

### Reflection
This assignment was very hard and took me a long time to finish it. I hope to improve greatly by the onshape certification exam.

### Reflection
The base was very simple to make it was simple a few rectangles and 2 circles with holes in them. The two useful shortcuts were n and p for toggles planes and normal to.

## Trucks

This represents the bottom part of he skateboard which connects the wheels and skateboard. it was a large quantity of extrusions and circles as well as a handful of fillets.

### Reflection
During the trucks I made a mistake at some point and learned the important difference between a surface extrusion and a part extrusion.

### Reflection
The wheels were very simple and quick to make.

### Reflection
The assembly was very simple to put together. I liked the batch fill option on Onshape.

### Reflection
this part was a little confusing and it took me a little bit to figure out how to embed it into the board but the cut tool was easy to use.



## Lego_pieces

### Description
Just a simple red Lego brick with a linear pattern and an extrude with a fillet

### Reflection
This part was quick to make the only new part was the introduction of a few variables


## Configurations

### Description
the settings to make it any required size were made so you can have any type of piece

### Reflection
this part was more complicated because I needed to learn to use configurations and learned that one must click the setting they wish to put into it and not just the part as a whole.

## Duck

### Reflection
the assembly was a tad weird but snap mode was not hard outside of the failure of snapping which happened accidently sometimes.


## Multi-tool

### Description

this is a multi-tool that can measure distances as well as a protracter and can also screw things in.

### Reflection

This was relatively simple to draw from the sketch this time and it was much easier than the joint I had to draw earlier.
